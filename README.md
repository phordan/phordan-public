# Welcome to phordan-public!

I am [phordan](https://x.com/_phordan), a designer, developer, and musician.

This repo contains the source code for my public site, [phordan.com](https://phordan.com), built with react-router v7, React, and TailwindCSS. 

The site serves as my personal reserved space on the internet to record my thoughts and resources about design, animation, development, music production, and more. It's also a place for me to feature my work and share it with the world.

I've shared this source code of the live site so that anyone interested can see how it works, explore the components, and get a sense of how this particular solo-dev designed a personal site/webapp.
